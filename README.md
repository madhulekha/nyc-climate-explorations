# NYC Climate Explorations

This repository contains ongoing, independent data analyses exploring how climate impacts New York City neighborhoods.

The goal is to better understand NYC climate policy, public datasets, and equity implications through exploratory analysis and public writing.

This work is intended as a learning and civic exploration project and
is not affiliated with the City of New York or any government agency.

## Focus areas
- Heat vulnerability and extreme heat risk
- Cooling centers and adaptive infrastructure
- Urban heat island effects
- Equity and neighborhood-level impacts

## Structure
Each folder under `notebooks/` represents a focused question or theme.
Analyses are exploratory and may evolve over time.

## Data sources
Primarily NYC Open Data, Census / ACS, and publicly available climate
datasets. Links and notes are maintained in the `data/` folder.

## Writing
Some analyses are accompanied by public write-ups (e.g. Substack),
with links included where relevant.
